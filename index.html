								My research focuses on astronomical distance measurements using Cepheid stars with the goal of a 1% determination of the Hubble constant H<sub>0</sub>. The current tension between the local measurement of H<sub>0</sub> based on Cepheid and Type Ia supernova distances (H<sub>0</sub> = 73.04 ± 1.04 km/s/Mpc by the SH0ES team) and its value inferred from the Λ-CDM model calibrated with CMB data in the early universe (H<sub>0</sub> = 67.4 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc) has reached a 5σ significance. This intriguing discrepancy, which has been recently confirmed with JWST observations of Cepheids, provides growing hints of new physics beyond Λ-CDM.
								<br>
								<br>The first rung of the SH0ES distance ladder is the calibration of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation (or Leavitt law) with absolute geometric distances. Then, Cepheids are used to solve for the peak SNIa luminosity. Finally, SNIa in the Hubble Flow directly measure the expansion rate of the universe, H<sub>0</sub>.
								<br>
								<br>I am working on improving the primary calibration of Cepheids in the Local Group, in particular with Cepheid parallaxes from the Gaia satellite in the Milky Way (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...643A.115B/abstract">Breuval et al. 2020</a>). I am also interested in reducing the systematic uncertainties in Cepheid distances, in particular the metallicity dependence (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...913...38B/abstract">Breuval et al. 2021</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939...89B/abstract">2022</a>). Recently, I used HST photometry to measure Cepheid distances to the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) in order to increase the number of geometric calibrators for the distance ladder and improve the H<sub>0</sub> measurement (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240408038B/abstract">Breuval et al. 2024</a>). Following a similar method, I measured the most precise distance to the M33 galaxy (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...951..118B/abstract">Breuval et al. 2023</a>) which should provide an additional anchor when geometric measurements become available. Finally, I also started investigating different methods of distance measurement such as the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and Carbon stars (the J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch, JAGB), which can substitute Cepheids in the distance ladder.
